CPU Code Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of three different C++ programs involving CPU simulations and operations. Each code snippet represents a distinct concept and purpose.

Code 1: Simple Key Input and Display

Purpose:

This program captures a character input from the user, displays the cumulative characters entered, and halts execution when the user inputs q.

Features:

Captures user input through std::cin.

Accumulates and displays the entered characters.

Halts execution when the input is q.

Usage:

Run the program, input characters, and observe the cumulative display. Input q to quit.

Code 2: CPU Simulation with Basic IN and OUT Operations

Purpose:

Simulates a basic CPU with input and output devices, allowing data transfer between a simulated input device, registers, and an output device.

Features:

Contains 8 general-purpose registers.

Simulates data transfer between input, registers, and output.

Displays the output device's value.

Usage:

Run the program to observe the value transferred from the input device to the output device via a register.

Code 3: Virtual CPU with I/O-Intensive Program

Purpose:

Simulates a more complex virtual CPU with a memory-based instruction set and I/O-intensive operations.

Features:

Supports memory-based program loading and execution.

Handles input/output operations using a simulated instruction set.

Outputs register values to the console.

Usage:

Run the program to interact with the virtual CPU. Follow the input prompts to provide values, and observe outputs based on the loaded program.

Conclusion

These programs demonstrate progressively advanced CPU simulations, from basic input/output operations to a memory-based virtual CPU model with an instruction set. They provide insights into how CPUs handle data and execute instructions.
