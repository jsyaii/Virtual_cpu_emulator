## Code 1: Simple Key Input and Display

### Purpose:

This program captures a character input from the user, displays the cumulative characters entered, and halts execution when the user inputs `q`.

### Features:

- Captures user input through `std::cin`.
- Accumulates and displays the entered characters.
- Halts execution when the input is `q`.

### Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. Input characters one at a time.
3. Observe the cumulative display of characters entered.
4. Input `q` to terminate the program.

## Code 2: CPU Simulation with Basic IN and OUT Operations

### Purpose:

Simulates a basic CPU with input and output devices, allowing data transfer between a simulated input device, registers, and an output device.

### Features:

- Contains **8 general-purpose registers**.
- Simulates data transfer between:
  - Input device → Register → Output device.
- Displays the value present in the output device.

### Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. Provide simulated input values as prompted.
3. Observe how data is transferred from the input device to the output device via a register.

## Code 3: Virtual CPU with I/O-Intensive Program

### Purpose:

Simulates a more complex virtual CPU with a memory-based instruction set and I/O-intensive operations.

### Features:

- **Memory-based program loading and execution**:
  - Accepts and processes instructions stored in simulated memory.
- Handles input/output using a simulated instruction set.
- Outputs the values of registers to the console.

### Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. Follow prompts to input values or commands as required.
3. Observe the execution of the memory-based program and the resulting register values displayed on the console.
